alright firstly id like to start out with the code i had envisioned to the actual code of the original website is ENTIRELY different
i get im new but after reviewing the original code i could have saved myself a lot of work applying the same id to different parts of the form
i decided to commit and finish how i envisioned the code to be partly for a few reasons
firstly i can come back once i have a lot more experience and redo and see the difference
in all honestly it didnt turn out that bad so regardless in difference of code im happy with the progress i did on my own

points to note for future me this addresses issues that i have and want to ahmend 

every name email age role recommend section needs to be the exact same style
when doing the input type radio i need to do it so text goes to the right of it currently i have display block which prevents me doing this--
-- i need to display block the div not the content so this is noted
the submit button is not inline with the rest of the form i can't be asked to change it as of now but i will make sure this is ahmended in future

anyway good job me at a real first attempt you did pretty good :)
